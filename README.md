# Healthy Habits Quiz

The **Healthy Habits Quiz** is an interactive, web-based application designed to engage users in a fun and educational experience, helping them assess and reflect on their daily habits while providing actionable tips to promote a healthier lifestyle. This is my second portfolio project for the **Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Diploma**, where I have implemented JavaScript functionality alongside HTML and CSS to create a dynamic and responsive application.

This project builds upon the lessons learned from my first project, focusing on enhancing user interactivity, responsiveness, and overall functionality. With this project, I aim to showcase my growth as a developer while delivering a meaningful and enjoyable experience to users.
